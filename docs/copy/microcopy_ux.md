## Principles

1. **Clear > Clever** - Users should never have to guess
2. **Concise** - Every word earns its place
3. **Helpful** - Guide users to success
4. **Human** - Sound like a helpful colleague, not a robot

## Voice & Tone

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|--------|
| **Success** | Celebratory | "Nice! Your component is ready." |
| **Error** | Empathetic | "Oops, something went wrong. Let's fix it." |
| **Waiting** | Reassuring | "Generating your code... This usually takes 2-3 seconds." |
| **Empty** | Encouraging | "No projects yet? Let's create your first one!" |

## Common Patterns

### Buttons
- ✅ "Start Free Trial" (specific)
- ❌ "Submit" (generic)

### Error Messages
- ✅ "Email already registered. Try logging in instead."
- ❌ "Error: Duplicate entry."

### Empty States
- ✅ "No components saved yet. Generate your first one!"
- ❌ "No data."

### Loading States
- ✅ "Generating your code..."
- ❌ "Loading..."

## Form Fields

| Field | Label | Placeholder | Helper Text |
|-------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Email | Email | you@example.com | We'll send login info here |
| Password | Password | Min. 8 characters | Use letters, numbers & symbols |
| Project Name | Project name | my-awesome-app | Letters, numbers, hyphens only |

---

## Validation Messages

| Error | Message |
|-------|--------|
| Required field | "This field is required" |
| Invalid email | "Please enter a valid email" |
| Password too short | "Password must be at least 8 characters" |
| Network error | "Connection lost. Check your internet and try again." |

## Tooltips & Help Text

- Keep under 140 characters
- Answer "What is this?" or "Why should I care?"
- Link to docs for complex topics

**Example:**
> "TypeScript Strict Mode: Catches more bugs at compile time. Recommended for production apps. [Learn more]"
